# Contributing
You can contribute by testing pre-releases and notifying us of bugs via issues.

If you want to contribute via code, you can fork the community branch, and push to the community branch.

We will not be pushing any changes to the main branch to prevent malware, however we may take note of pushes to the community branch and may manually code it in.
