### // This is still being made. Come back later.

## Supported Programming languages

## Features

### Extensions

Extensions can be used to make your experience better while using the IDE.

You can use extensions to:

Support unsupported programming languages

Change the colors of the IDE

Add more features

And more.

Extensions are free and you can create your own.

### Automatic Installation

When creating a project for a supported programming language, if it isn't installed, it will install everything required.

### AI Assistant

You can run AI agents via Ollama (or AI api providers like OpenAi), and they can help you code your projects.

### Onedrive support

One of the problems of most other IDEs is the lack of support for cloud coding.

With this IDE, you can save projects to Onedrive, and the IDE will automatically detect all projects stored in Onedrive, so you can work on multiple computers.

### Advanced debugging

You can go line by line, being able to see variables change, where the crashes occur, etc.

## What is planned for the future
We're planning to turn this into an entire developer workstation, with virtual machines, operating system builders, and more.
